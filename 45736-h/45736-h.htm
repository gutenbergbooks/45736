<h2>To<br />

Robert Louis Stevenson.</h2>


<p><i>The crowning pleasure in the compilation of this
book is the permission to dedicate it to you, and
this token of personal admiration is not without special
fitness, since you were among the earliest to experiment
in these French rhythms, and to introduce</i> <span class="smcap">Charles
d'Orl&eacute;ans</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fran&ccedil;ois Villon</span> <i>to the majority of
English readers</i>.</p>

<p><i>"Those old French ways of verse making that have been coming
into fashion of late. Surely they say a pretty thing more
prettily for their quaint old-fashioned liberty! That</i> <span class="smcap">TRIOLET</span>&mdash;<i>how
deliciously impertinent it is! is it not?... The variety
of dainty modes wherein by shape and sound a very pretty
something is carved out of nothing at all. Their fantastic
surprises, the ring of their bell-like returns upon themselves,
their music of triangle and cymbal. In some of them poetry
seems to approach the nearest possible to bird-song&mdash;to unconscious
seeming through most unconscious art, imitating the carelessness
and impromptu of forms as old as the existence of birds, and
as new as every fresh individual joy in each new generation,
growing their own feathers, and singing their own song, yet
always the feathers of their kind, and the song of their kind."&mdash;</i></p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<hr />

<p>This anthology is chosen entirely from poems
written in the traditional fixed forms of
the <i>ballade</i>, <i>chant royal</i>, <i>kyrielle</i>, <i>rondel</i>,
<i>rondeau</i>, <i>rondeau redoubl&eacute;</i>, <i>sestina</i>, <i>triolet</i>, <i>villanelle</i>,
and <i>virelai</i>, with the addition of the <i>pantoum</i>.
That such a choice is the result of circumstances
it is needless to point out, since only those that had
found favour with English writers were available
for the purpose. So far as I know, this collection
is the first of its sort, although Mr. W. Davenport
Adams' <i>Latter Day Lyrics</i> included a section
chosen on the same lines. Having, in company,
no doubt, with many others, a genuine regard
for the group Mr. Adams included there, I had
long hoped to see a more ample compilation of
later work in this school; but notwithstanding the
steady increase in the number of poems written
in the forms systematically arranged herein,
the ground remained unoccupied, until the
appearance of this book; which may fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
claim to be the first in the field, since no other
volume has devoted its whole space to them, save
in the rarer cases, where an author has published
a collection of original poems cast in one mould,
notably Mr. Swinburne's <i>Century of Roundels</i> and
Mr. Andrew Lang's <i>Ballades in Blue China</i>.</p>

<p>In Mr. Adams' volume another valuable feature
was the <i>Note on some Foreign forms of Verse</i> by
Mr. Austin Dobson, which many years since
introduced to me the laws of the various forms
and created my special interest in them. It is
no derogation to the charming group in the former
volume to say of the present collection, that it
far exceeds its predecessor in number and variety,
for now there is a wide field to choose from, whereas
Mr. Adams was then limited to a selection from the
small number extant.</p>

<p>The rules which Mr. Austin Dobson was the
first to formulate in English are made the basis (side
by side with the treatises of M. de Gramont, M. de
Banville, and other authorities) of the following
chapter on the rules of the various forms. Lest a
name so intimately associated with the introduction
of the old French metrical shapes in English
poetry should appear to be brought in to add
weight to my own attempt, and the reputation of
a master invoked for the work of one who at
furthest can but style himself an apprentice, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
must ask that this necessary tribute to Mr.
Dobson's labours be taken only as an apology for
so freely using his material, and that his ready
help is by no means to be regarded in the faintest
way as an imprimatur of any statements in this
prefatory matter, save those quoted avowedly and
directly from his writings.</p>

<p>It may be best to name at once the authorities
who have been consulted in the preparation of the
introductory chapter. These include the French
treatises of De Banville, De Gramont, and Jullienne,
Mr. Saintsbury's <i>Short History of French Literature</i>,
Mr. Hueffers' <i>Troubadours</i>, an article by Mr.
Gosse in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>, July 1877, <i>Les
Villanelles</i> by M. Joseph Boulmier, <i>The Rhymester</i>
of Mr. Brander Matthews, and many occasional
papers on the various forms that have appeared in
English and American periodicals. To arrange in
one chapter the materials gathered from these and
other sources is all that I have attempted. If at
times the need to crowd enough matter for a
volume into the limits of a few pages results in a
want of lucidity, I must plead the necessity imposed
by limited space. To those who, by their kindly
permission, have allowed their poems to be quoted
here, the thanks that I can offer are as hearty as the
expression of my gratitude is brief. The somewhat
onerous task of obtaining consent from about two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
hundred authors has been turned to a pleasure, by
the evidence of interest taken in this, the first
collection of the later growth of this branch of poetic
art. Nor did the help cease with the loan of the
poems; in many instances a correspondence
followed that brought to light fresh material, both
for the body of the book and the introductory
chapter, and rendered assistance not easy to overvalue.
If any writer is quoted without direct permission,
it was through no want of effort to trace
him, excepting in the case of a very few that
reached me in the shape of newspaper cuttings,
wholly devoid of any clue to the locality of the
writer. To Mr. Austin Dobson my best thanks are
due. From Mr. Andrew Lang and Mr. Edmund
Gosse I have also appropriated material, acknowledged
as often as practicable; also to my friend,
Mr. A. G. Wright, for invaluable help during the
rather monotonous task of hunting up and copying
at the reading-room of the British Museum;
and to Mr. William Sharp, whose critical advice
and generous encouragement throughout have left
a debt of gratitude beyond payment.</p>

<p>In a society paper, <i>The London</i>, a brilliant series
of these poems appeared during 1877-8. After a
selection was made for this volume, it was discovered
that they were all by <i>one</i> author, Mr.
W. E. Henley, who most generously permitted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
whole of those chosen to appear, and to be for the
first time publicly attributed to him. The poems
themselves need no apology, but in the face of so
many from his pen, it is only right to explain the
reason for the inclusion of so large a number.</p>

<p>From America Mr. Brander Matthews and Mr.
Clinton Scollard have shown sympathy with the
collection, not only by permitting their works to be
cited, but also by calling my attention to poems by
authors almost unknown in England; while all
those writers who in the new world are using the
old shapes with a peculiar freshness and vigour,
gave ready assent to the demand.</p>

<p>To Messrs. Cassell &amp; Co., for allowing poems
that appeared in <i>Cassell's Family Magazine</i>
(those by Miss Ada Louise Martin and Mr. G.
Weatherley); to Messrs. Longman, for liberty to
quote freely from the many graceful examples that
appeared in <i>Longman's Magazine</i>; to Messrs.
Kegan Paul, Trench, &amp; Co., for endorsing Mr.
Andrew Lang's permission to include specimens
from <i>Rhymes &agrave; la Mode</i> and <i>Ballades in Blue
China</i>, the utmost thanks are due for the courtesy
shown; also to the proprietors of the <i>Century
Magazine</i>, where so many of the American poems
(many since collected by the authors in their own
volumes) first appeared; and to Messrs Harper for
permission to use Mr. Coleman's <i>Sestina</i>, and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
Graham R. Tomson's <i>Ballade of the Bourne</i>, which
first appeared in their popular monthly. The poems
that are cited by the courtesy of Mr. John Payne
appear respectively in <i>Songs of Life and Death</i>
(W. H. Allen &amp; Co.), <i>New Poems</i> (ditto), and <i>Poems
by Fran&ccedil;ois Villon</i> (Reeves &amp; Turner), now out of
print.</p>

<p>Having named so many who have lent aid, it is
but fair to exonerate them from any blame for
errors that, no doubt, in spite of the utmost care,
may have crept in. In view of a later edition, I
should be glad to be informed of any additional
data of the use of the forms in English verse,
which, if quoted, would add to the value of the
collection, or to have any erroneous statements
corrected.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the many shortcomings of my
own share in the production of this volume, I
cannot doubt but that the charm of the poems
themselves will endear it to readers; and as a lover
of the "Gallic bonds," I venture to hope it may
do some little towards their complete naturalisation
in our tongue.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the limited space available, it is hardly possible to
give more than a very crude sketch of the origin
of these forms; but some reference to early Proven&ccedil;al
literature is inevitable, since the nucleus of not a few
of them can be traced among the intricate rhyming
of the Troubadours. Yet it would be beyond the
purpose to go minutely into the enticing history of that
remarkable period, nor is it needful to raise disputed
questions regarding the origin of each particular fashion.
The number of books on Proven&ccedil;al subjects is great, the
mere enumeration of the names of those in the library of
the British Museum would fill several pages. The
language itself has a fascination which allures many to
disaster, for as Mr. Hueffer points out, it "looks at first
sight so like the Latin and more familiar Romance
languages that it offers special temptations" to guess at
its meaning, with very doubtful success.</p>

<p>The term Proven&ccedil;al is usually applied to a dialect
more correctly known as "the Langue d'Oc, which, with
the Langue d'Oil, forms the two divisions of the Romance
language spoken in the country we now know as
France;" but Mr. Saintsbury remarks that, strictly
speaking, the Langue d'Oc should not be called "French"
at all, since it is hardly more akin to the Langue d'Oil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
than it is to Spanish and Italian, and that those who
spoke it applied the term "French" to northern speech,
calling their own Limousin, or Proven&ccedil;al, or Auvergnat.
The limits where it prevailed extended far beyond
Provence itself. Authorities differ with regard to the
exact boundaries. It will suffice for the present purpose
to take those Mr. Hueffer adopts&mdash;namely, the district
within a boundary formed by a line drawn from the
mouth of the Gironde to that of the Saone, in the
north, while the southern limit includes parts of Spain,
such as Aragon, Valencia, Catalonia, and the Balearic
Islands.</p>

<p>Herr Karl Bartsch, the eminent historian of Proven&ccedil;al
literature, divides it into three periods:&mdash;the
first, to the end of the eleventh century; the second,
which is the one that marks the most flourishing time
of the poetry of the Troubadours, extending over the
twelfth and thirteenth; and the third period&mdash;of its
decadence&mdash;in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
To this may be added the attempt to revive it in our own
day, by the school of the so-called <i>F&eacute;libres</i>, including
Mistral, Aubanel, Alphonse Daudet, and others, who
have worked vigorously, and with no mean success, to
produce a modern literature in the old dialect, worthy
of its former dignity. In this preface it is impossible
to mention any part of the prose of this marvellous
literature, which sprang almost suddenly into a gigantic
growth, that has been a fruitful theme for wonder and
admiration ever since, and left its influence widely felt.
The point that is to the purpose here, concerns the
invention by the Proven&ccedil;al poets of many set forms of
verse, some few of which are still written, but most so
altered and renewed by later use, that their original
character is well-nigh obscured. The forms included in
this book are often erroneously attributed <i>en masse</i> to
the <i>jongleurs</i> of Provence, yet few assumptions are less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
true. Altered by the Trouv&egrave;res, the fifteenth century
poets, the Ronsardists, and later writers, it is safer
to assign to the Troubadours only the germs which
evolved gradually into their now matured forms. To
linger over the extraordinary period is a temptation
hard to dismiss; the very name still has a flavour of
romance, and brings a curious medley of images to
the mind when it is heard, many perhaps as far from
the actual Proven&ccedil;al Troubadour as <i>Nanki-Poo</i> in the
"<i>Mikado</i>" is from the wandering minstrel of the court
of King Thibaut. Of the Troubadours who have come
down to fame, four hundred and sixty are recorded by
name, besides two hundred and fifty-one pieces that
have survived without evidence of their authors. King
Richard I. (our own C&oelig;ur de Lion), Guillem de
Cabestanh, Peire Vidal, Bertran de Born, The Monk of
Montaudon, and many others, have biographical sketches
of exceeding interest allotted to them in Mr. Hueffer's
"The Troubadours." A halo of romance has gathered
round their names, and thrown a glamour over the
record of their lives; to read their history is to be
transported to a region where all topics but love and
song are deemed unimportant trifles, unless the old
chroniclers are singularly untruthful in their statements.
We know now-a-days many a young poet's
crushed life appears only in his verses, and outside those
he appears but an average Philistine to vulgar eyes.
Perhaps the "land of the nightingale and rose" was
not so idyllic as its historians paint it; but with every
deduction, there yet remains evidence of an exceptional
importance attached to the arts, more especially to that
of song. To those who wrote, or rather sang, witty
impromptus (made often, we can but fancy, with
much labour beforehand), or produced dainty conceits in
elaborate rhymes and rhythms, when sound came
perilously near triumphing over sense, a welcome was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
extended, as widespread and far more personal in its
application than even that accorded to our modern
substitute for the troubadour&mdash;the popular novelist.
The doings of the Courts of Love, set down in sober
chronicles, are hardly less fantastic than Mr. Gilbert's
ingenious operas. Matters of the most sentimental
and amorous character were debated in public, with
all the earnestness of a question of state. That
their poetry was singularly limited in its character
there is little doubt, but Mr. Hueffer declares that it
had its serious side, often lost sight of, and that no
small portion was devoted to stately and dignified
subjects. Mr. Lowell, on the other hand, in an essay on
Chaucer in <i>My Study Windows</i>, says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Their poetry is purely lyric in its most narrow sense, that
is, the expression of personal and momentary moods. To
the fancy of the critics who take their cue from tradition,
Provence is a morning sky of early summer, out of which
innumerable larks rain a faint melody (the sweeter because
rather half divined than heard too distinctly) over an earth
where the dew never dries and the flowers never fade. But
when we open Raynouard it is like opening the door of an
aviary. We are deafened and confused by a hundred
minstrels singing the same song at once, and more than
suspect the flowers they welcome are made of French
cambric, spangled with dewdrops of prevaricating glass."</p></blockquote>

<p>The forms in which the Proven&ccedil;al poets wrote were
chiefly these:&mdash;The oldest was called <i>vers</i>, and consisted
of octosyllabic lines arranged in stanzas; from this grew
the <i>canzo</i>, with interlaced rhymes&mdash;later on with the
distinctive feature still prominent in French, but unknown
in English poetry, the rhymes <i>masculine</i> and
<i>feminine</i>. The <i>canzo</i> was used entirely for subjects of
love and gallantry, but the <i>sirvente</i>, composed of short
stanzas, simply rhyming, and corresponding one to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
other, was employed for political and social subjects,
sometimes treated seriously, at others satirically. The
<i>tenso</i> was a curious trial of skill in impromptu versification.
Two antagonists met and agreed that the one
should reply on the opposite side to any argument the
first might select. The opening stanza, chosen at will
by the speaker, was imitated in the reply, both in observance
of its rhyme and rhythm, the same rhyme-sound
being often kept throughout the whole poem. It
must not be forgotten that the Langue d'Oc was singularly
fertile in rhymes, so that the feat was less arduous
than it would be in other tongues. The <i>alba</i>, a farewell
at morning, and the <i>serena</i>, or evening song, the <i>pastorella</i>,
devoted, as its name implies, to pastoral subjects, appear to
govern the themes of the verses rather than the form.
There is record, however, of the <i>breu-doble</i> (double short),
invented by Guirant Riquier, a little form with three
rhymes, two of which are repeated twice in three four-lined
stanzas, and given once in a concluding couplet,
while the third finished each quatrain. The <i>retroensa</i>
is noticeable for its refrain of more than one line. The
sonnet has ceased to be claimed as a Proven&ccedil;al invention,
yet it must be noted, as at one time its origin there
was a favourite theory. The <i>ballade</i>, "a song serving
to accompany the dance," must not be confused with the
later ballade; and lastly, the greatest in most respects,
the <i>sestina</i>, which, as it occurs among the poems
noticed technically later on, need not be further
mentioned here.</p>

<p>"The artificial verse-forms of Provence include some
as peculiar and arbitrary as ever issued from the brain of
Persian poet&mdash;verse-forms by the side of which the
metrical glitter of <i>ballade</i>, <i>chant royal</i>, <i>rondeau</i>, <i>rondel</i>,
<i>triolet</i>, <i>virelai</i> and <i>villanelle</i> must pale," says a writer
in the <i>Westminster Review</i> (October 1878), and
instances the <i>tenso</i> and the <i>sestina</i> in proof of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
assertion. Mr. Hueffer also treats the <i>chant royal</i> as
mere child's play beside the intricate feats displayed by
the Troubadours. The above short list shows many examples
of forms using the refrain and some other features
preserved in Northern poetry; but the debt owed by the
North to the Troubadours is far less, according to later
writers, than that assigned to Proven&ccedil;al influence some
few years ago. Mr. Saintsbury says that "poems
called <i>rondeaux</i> and <i>ballades</i>, of loose construction and
undecided form, began to make their appearance at the
end of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth
century," but the forms as we know them owe their
present shape to their reformation in Northern France,
culminating in the poems of Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans and
Fran&ccedil;ois Villon. In this revival, the <i>lai</i> and <i>pastourelle</i>
kept their Proven&ccedil;al titles, but were made much
more exact in form, and never attained the widespread
celebrity of the newer shapes, which are to all intents
and purposes the models for the forms in this volume,
save the <i>sestina</i>, which is practically an Italian, and
the <i>pantoum</i>, an Eastern form.</p>

<p>There is no space here to notice more than the names of
a few of even the most prominent of the poets who
succeeded the Proven&ccedil;al singers in their use of these
forms. There are thousands of ballades in MSS. in the
Royal French Library, by known and unknown writers.
Eustache Deschamps (1328-1415), a friend of Chaucer's,
"has left no less than 1175 ballades. Rondeaus,
virelais, etc., also proceeded in great numbers from
his pen; also an important <i>Art of Poetry</i>, a treatise
rendered at once necessary and popular by the fashion
of artificial rhyming."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Some of the earliest ballades
and rondel-triolets bear the name of Jehan Froissart
(1337-1410), the chronicler. Messire Guy de la Tremouille,
according to Mr. Gosse, is supposed to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>been the first to devise the elaborate rules of construction
of the ballade, which have been in force ever
since. He was guard of the Oriflamme in 1383, and
died in 1398; but Deschamps is more often credited
with the honour. That he cultivated the form we know,
besides writing an "Art of making Chansons, Ballades,
Virelais, and Rondels," which is a valuable relic of his
time. Jehannot de Lescurel, "of whom absolutely
nothing is known, has left sixteen ballades, fifteen
rondeaus (not in regular form), and other pieces, said to
be 'of singular grace, lightness, and elegance.'"</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> See Saintsbury's <i>Short History of French Literature</i>, p. 103.</p></div>

<p>Guillaume de Machault (1284-1377) was also a voluminous
writer. One of his poems, a <i>chanson ballad&eacute;e</i>,
is printed in Mr. Saintsbury's <i>Short History of French
Literature</i>, which contains also a <i>Ballade</i> by Alain
Chartier (1390-1458), the hero of the famous story of the
kiss of Queen Margaret of Scotland, and other specimens
of this period, in a succinct and trustworthy account of
the growth of French poetry, surpassed by no book in
our own language.</p>

<p>Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans (1391-1466), noticed among the
English writers, is specially honoured as the master of
the rondel; while Fran&ccedil;ois Villon (1431-1485) stands out
as the "prince of all ballade-makers." For brief, but
splendid sketches of these two, Mr. R. L. Stevenson's
<i>Familiar Studies of Men and Books</i> should be consulted,
while for more prosaic description there is no lack of
data. Since the revival of interest in Villon, France has
done tardy but unstinted honour to her most famous poet,
as it is the fashion just now to style him, but there is a
doubt whether the praise given is not in danger of
being exaggerated. Yet, making all allowances, there
is vital humanity in his wondrous writings, that now,
after four hundred years, read as living and modern in
their presentation of life, as though they were by a
realist of our own day. In Villon, student, poet, house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>breaker,
we find the forerunner of the Zola of to-day&mdash;one
who, in so eminently an artificial form as the ballade, cast
aside all conventional restraints, and sang of what he saw
and knew. It is much to be regretted that space forbids
more translations of his poems to be included in this
collection. For those who wish to tackle him in his
old, and by no means easy, French, a good edition is
published for a franc, in the <i>Collection Jannet-Picard
(Paris)</i>. Mr. Payne has translated the whole of his
authentic works into English in a volume, at present
out of print, which contains also a very graphic and full
biography of this remarkable man. Space forbids
insertion of the sketch of his life prepared for this
chapter. Born in 1431, student 1448, B.A. in 1452,
writing his <i>Lesser Testament</i> in 1446, his <i>Greater
Testament</i> in 1461; in those few years he contrived
to win more fame, and, to speak truly, more infamy,
than a whole generation of lesser poets. He was
condemned to die&mdash;he wrote his marvellous <i>Ballade
of the Gibbet</i> while lying under sentence of death&mdash;but
escaped. Where he died is unknown, the date of his
<i>Greater Testament</i> being the last record of Master
Fran&ccedil;ois Villon of Paris.</p>

<p>In 1493 appeared <i>L'art et science de rh&eacute;thorique pour
faire rigmes et ballades</i>, by Henry de Cro&iuml;&mdash;an invaluable
treatise on French Poetics. The works of Pierre
Gringoire (1478-1544) must be named, if only for the
fact of De Banville's splendid ballade in his comedy
"Gringoire," founded on an incident in the poet's life.
By Mr. Lang's permission a translation is quoted in the
body of this volume. Mr. John Payne also englished it,
in the <i>Dublin University Magazine</i>, 1879. The works
of Clement Marot (1497-1544) demand special note, since
his <i>ballades</i> and <i>chants royaux</i> are now accepted as the
ideal models for imitation.</p>

<p>In his <i>Art Po&euml;tique</i>, 1555, Thomas Sibilet reviews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
many of the former writers, and gives the rules of the
poetry then in force. Immediately after this date
came another change; with the famous school of
Ronsard (1524-1585) and the <i>Pl&eacute;iade</i>, as they are
styled, one of whom, however, Du Bellay, was eager
to abolish the <i>ballade</i> and <i>chant royal</i> in favour
of the <i>sonnet</i>. The members of this group produced
some notable work in strict forms. Among the
Ronsardists we find Gr&eacute;vin the dramatist, who wrote
some graceful poems which he called <i>Villanesques</i>&mdash;a
modified form of the <i>Villanelle</i>&mdash;and Jean Passerat
(1534-1602) who is specially noteworthy, since in his
hand the <i>Villanelle</i> crystallised into its present shape,
Joseph Boulmier, in the last revival, making this
form his special study, and writing all his verses after
Passerat's model given elsewhere in this volume.</p>

<p>The rondeau was revived in great splendour in the
middle of the seventeenth century. Foremost among the
brilliant group is Voiture (1598-1648), the acknowledged
master of this form. Only thirty of his rondeaus are
left, but each one of these is a masterpiece, and
may be studied for all the subtle devices and
dainty inventions that the form has yet yielded.
Benserade (1612-1691) and Sarrasin were also famous
for rondeau-making, the former translating the whole of
Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i> into rondeaus, which were sumptuously
printed at the King's Press at a cost of 10,000
francs. When Voiture died in 1648, it is curious to note
that Sarrasin wrote a "pompous funereal poem&mdash;possibly
the most funny serious elegy ever composed&mdash;in which,
among other strange mourners, he makes the 'poor little
triolet,' all in tears, trot by the side of the dead poet,"
who, according to Mr. Gosse, from whom the above
paragraph is quoted, had never written one in his life.
Sarrasin also left a curious specimen of the <i>Glose</i>, written
on the famous Sonnet "de IOB" by Benserade. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
1649 G&eacute;rard de Saint Amant wrote a volume of sixty-four
triolets. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth
century no important examples occur. About thirty
years ago De Banville revived these old shapes, and
initiated a movement that Daudet, Glatigny, Boulmier,
and a host of others have helped forward, so that now
modern French literature is flooded with examples of the
forms-the ballade, rondeau, and triolet being the most
widely used.</p>

<p>Having imperfectly followed the growth of the forms
in France, it will be interesting to give a few notes
of the various attempts made to acclimatise some in
England. Although no effort previous to 1873 warrants
us in claiming an English pedigree for them, yet it is
curious to see how often the attempt was made to write
them in our own tongue. The sonnet gradually
grew into use, until it became as little an exotic
as the potato, to employ an uncouth simile; the
ballade and rondeau&mdash;hardly more formal in their
rules, and with susceptibilities of infinite grace and
beauty&mdash;failed to be even residents amongst us, much less
naturalised subjects, sharing the rights and duties of
citizens. Chaucer is believed to have used these forms,
as in "The Legend of Good Women" he says, speaking
of himself&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Many a himpne for your holy daies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That highten balades, roundels, virelaies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His "Balade de Vilage sauns Peynture," however, does
not correspond with the accepted form. Mr. Gosse says
that the Chaucer of 1651 contains a number of poems
attributed to himself and Lydgate "which are merely
pieces in rhyme-royal, so arranged as to imitate the
French ballade: without its severity of form."</p>

<p>This is given in Furnival's <i>Trial-Forewords to Chaucer's
Minor Poems</i>, and is especially interesting in connection
with the history of the forms in English use.</p>

<p>Of his immediate followers, Lydgate, a monk of Bury,
author of <i>London Lyckpenny</i>, is said by Guest to have
written a "roundle," and one by Thomas Occleve is
printed in Morley's <i>Shorter English Poems</i>.</p>

<p>John Gower (1340-1408), author of <i>Confessio Amantis</i>,
at the coronation of Henry IV. presented the king
with a collection of fifty <i>Ballades</i>, written in the Proven&ccedil;al
manner, "to entertain his noble court." The
thin oblong MS., on vellum, which contains them is
still extant in the Marquis of Stafford's library at Trentham,
and in 1818 it was printed for the Roxburghe
Club; but as the poems are unfortunately written in
French, they do not assist in supporting a claim for the
early use of the form in England. Professor Henry Morley
has translated one for his <i>English Writers</i>; it follows
the rhymes accurately, but has a somewhat trite subject.
A critic has well said of it, that the poets of Gowers's
day "were not burdened with solving 'the riddle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>the painful earth.' It may be that a good deal of
their guileless delight in things fresh and young was
feigned, but then so is much of our more pretentious
philosophy." From its special interest it is quoted here&mdash;</p>

<p>John Shirley, who lived about 1440, made a collection
of <i>Ballades</i>, <i>Roundels</i>, <i>Virelais</i>, and Tragedies, in MSS.,
which are still extant in the Ashmolean Museum at
Oxford. After noticing Gower, who wrote ballades in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
French, Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans, who wrote rondels in English,
comes as another instance of the early use, but again
as a mere exception, since the accident which led both
writers to adopt exotic forms is outside the history of
our native poetry, and cannot be brought forward to
prove their early naturalisation. Of Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans
much might be said worth saying, but there
are so many sources of information open, that here
we need note only the poems written during his captivity.
He is said to have been our prisoner for about twenty-five
years, and during that time to have acquired a taste
for our language. The Abb&eacute; Sallier, who unearthed the
manuscript of his poems in the Royal Library at Paris
during the last century, says he wrote but two in
English; but in the MS. at the British Museum, the
Rev. H. F. Cary, the translator of Dante, found
three, quoted in his <i>Early French Poets</i> (Bohn,
1846). The editor of that volume, the Rev. Henry
Cary, son of the author, mentions in a footnote a large
collection among the Harleian MSS., attributed to
Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans, but throws doubt on their being
more than translations. Into this question there is no
space to enter. These are the three from Cary's
book:&mdash;</p>

<p>Spenser (1553-1599) is said (but I cannot trace the
authority) to have used some of these forms. Again,
Sir Philip Sidney's (1554-1586) famous ditty, "My true
love hath my heart," recalls the rondel, but cannot
claim to be one. Drummond of Hawthornden (1585-1649)
has a fine sestina (too long for quotation), "Sith
gone is my delight and only pleasure."</p>

<p><i>The Trivial Poems, and Triolets</i> of Patrick Carey
deserve mention. This volume was unknown until the
beginning of the present century, although dated
Warnefurd, 1651. The poems were brought into notice
by Sir Walter Scott, who obtained the MSS. from John
Murray, and after inserting a few in the <i>Edinburgh
Annual Register</i>, 1810, published the whole for the first
time in 1819. The following specimen is taken from
Scott's reprint, p. 43:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, May 7, 1887, is a long article
on Carey, signed C. F. S. Warner, M. A. Charles
Cotton, the friend of Izaak Walton, wrote a rondeau,
"a very ungallant example," cited in Dr. Guests'
<i>History of English Rhythms</i>. There is also one
unquotable, by reason of its subject, among the correspondence
of Alexander Pope (1688-1744), and in the
<i>Rolliad</i>, 1784, a volume of satires in prose and verse, that
enjoyed a great popularity for a time, there is a set of
five rondeaus, written in pure form after the Voiture
model. They satirise North, Eden, Pitt, and Dorset, and
are perfect in construction, and vigorous in their ridicule.
The popularity of these effusions led to many imitations
in the periodical prints at the beginning of this
century, few, however, of sufficient merit to be worth
reviving. By the courtesy of Mr. Austin Dobson, the
owner, I am able to extract a specimen from a scarce
and little-known book, entitled <i>Rondeaulx; translated
from the Black Letter French Edition of 1527, by J. R.
Best, Esq.</i>;&mdash;</p>

<p>The dedication to Robert Studley Vidal, Esq., is
dated 1838. The first poem is preceded by a quaint
apology, that unfortunately is too long to quote, but
the rondeau itself, if its rhythm is faulty and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
language ungraceful, shows that the original had
sterling advice to offer, and that the translator was
not ignorant of the true rules of the form.</p>

<p>In Mr. Oxenford's <i>Book of French Songs</i>, now published
with Miss Costello's <i>Specimens of the Early Poetry of
France</i>, in a volume of the <i>Chandos Classics</i>, there
is one ballade given (with its original French, both
without envoy); but although noting the peculiarity
that each stanza has the same terminations, Mr.
Oxenford has not kept it in his translation, nor has
Miss Costello, in a numerous collection of ballades,
rondels, lais, and other forms, once paraphrased them
accurately, usually varying even the refrain; nor can I
see, in her voluminous notes, that she draws attention
to this important feature, although she gives the
particulars of the eccentricities of rhyming known as
<i>Fraternis&eacute;e, Bris&eacute;e</i>, and the like, and condemns their
triviality rather strongly. In the edition before me no
date is given; the authoress died in 1870. The oft-quoted
Rondeau by Leigh Hunt is so beautiful in itself that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>
all its shortcomings in the matter of form may be readily
pardoned, and if&mdash;but the saving clause is great&mdash;others
as beautiful could be built on the same shape, a "Leigh
Hunt" variation would be a welcome addition to the
forms in English; but it is no <i>rondeau</i>, and has not the
faintest claim to be so styled. Probably it is familiar to
all readers, but in case even one should not know it, it
is quoted here:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">Say I'm growing old, but add&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i24">Jenny kissed me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If Mr. Swinburne's examples of the forms in his earlier
volumes be not counted (since he then ignored many of
the rules that, as his later books show, he can use with
such splendid mastery), to Mr. Andrew Lang's <i>Lays and
Lyrics of Old France</i> (Longman, 1872) must be assigned
the honour of leading the way in the reproduction in
English of the old French metrical forms, made in conformance
to their ascertained laws. How far that
volume led the way to the modern employment of these
forms for original poetry in our own tongue, is not so
easily proved. One thing, at least, is certain, that Mr.
Austin Dobson, Mr. Edmund Gosse, Mr. W. E. Henley,
Mr. Payne, and one or two other writers, were each, unknown
to the rest, trying the new measures. In the
words of one of these, "the study of French literature
was in the air;" and naturally, as we now see, the new
movement began simultaneously to adapt its rules to
English conditions. To Mr. Bridges belongs the honour
of printing the first Triolet in modern English; but he
expressly disclaims being looked upon as the apostle for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
the naturalisation of the exotic forms, for which he had
no peculiar sympathy, and after his <i>Poems</i>, 1873,
ceased to use. So little were his experiments appreciated,
that their presence in his volume was considered
prejudicial to its success, by competent authorities of
the day, who little foresaw the rapid growth that would
so soon spring up. To Mr. Austin Dobson is assigned
the first <i>ballade</i>, "The Prodigals;" to Mr. Edmund
Gosse the first <i>villanelle</i> and <i>chant royal</i>; and to Mr.
W. E. Henley the first <i>double ballade</i>, and a few other
variations. But it is most likely that the priority of some
of these was due to the mere accident of publication, and
that it is more near the truth to regard the whole as a
contemporaneous movement toward French rhythms,
thought out and experimented upon by many writers,
ignorant of the fact that they were not alone in the
study, and that others were working upon the same
lines. One of the first who made trial of these French
rhythms has (I believe) never published any; yet examples
of their use by the author of <i>A Child's Garden of Verse</i>
would have added greatly to the interest of this collection,
but the author has willed that they should remain
unquoted, so I can only regret their absence.</p>

<p>From 1873 to 1877 a fair number had appeared, but
these were produced almost entirely by the writers
already named. From 1877, however, the number of
those who made them increased rapidly. In that year
Mr. Dobson's <i>Proverbs in Porcelain</i> was published,
containing a series of these forms, which, as internal
evidence of much subsequent work shows, have been
accepted as typical models to be followed in their
English use. The series in <i>The London</i> noticed elsewhere,
during this year and 1878, also increased their
popularity, while the later English use may be traced
to some extent by the examples here collected. In
America about the same time the new fashion in verse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>making
was taken up very warmly, and to the present
day the Americans have shown themselves more cordial
towards the Gallic measures than even our own countrymen.
In the popular periodicals of the United States
there are more specimens than in our English magazines,
and the appearance of so many examples in this book
shows that the American poets have caught a great
deal of the peculiar quality, hard to define but easy to
recognise, which the forms demand. Then came Mr.
W. Davenport Adams's <i>Latter Day Lyrics</i>, with a section
devoted to these forms, and "A Note on Some Foreign
Forms of Verse," by Mr. Dobson. Since then the poems
written in these styles have been increasing in number,
until the idea of collecting them in one volume, long in
my mind, was favourably entertained by Mr. William
Sharp, the general editor of the series in which this
book appears.</p>

<p>The taste for these <i>tours de force</i> in the art of versemaking
is no doubt an acquired one; yet to quote the
first attempt to produce a lyric with a repeated burden
would take one back to the earliest civilisation.
The use of the refrain and conventional arrangement
of rhyme in these forms differs as widely from the
burdens of the old examples, as the purely conventional
design of Greek art from the savage patterns
of its ancestral stock. Whether the first refrains
were used for decorative effect only, or to give the
singer time to recollect or to improvise the next
verse, it matters little, since the once mere adjunct was
made in later French use an integral and vital part of
the verse. The charm of these strictly written verses is
undoubtedly increased by some knowledge of their
technical rules. As a subtle harmony of colours may
reveal, to those who can grasp it, a miracle of skill and
science, while it is no more nor less than "a pretty picture"
to others&mdash;or polyphonic harmony, with all the resources<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>
of the science of music, may be employed to enrich a clear
popular melody, to which the unmusical can yet nod their
heads and fancy they understand it all; so a ballade or
rondeau may be so deftly wrought, with an infinity of
care and grace, that those who read it simply as a
dainty poem never suspect the stern laws ordering the
apparent spontaneity of the whole. To approach ideal
perfection, nothing less than implicit obedience to all
the rules is the first element of success; but the task is
by no means finished there. Every quality that poetry
demands, whether clearness of thought, elegance of
expression, harmonious sound, or faultless rhythm, is
needed as much in these shapes as in unfettered verse,
and not until all those are contributed comes the
final test of the poem itself; whether it utters thoughts
worth uttering, or suggests ideas worth recalling. It
may be said, without fear of exaggeration, that all the
qualities required to form a perfect lyric in poetry are
equally needful here, <i>plus</i> a great many special ones the
forms themselves demand. To the students of any art
there is always a peculiar charm when the highest
difficulties are surmounted with such ease, that the
consummate art is hidden to all who know not the
magic password to unveil it. But for those who have no
special knowledge of poetry, it is pertinent to inquire
what good these ingenious <i>tours de force</i> achieve,
and why the poem could not please as well if it
was written in ordinary verse? This is hard to
answer; but the fact remains that in every phase of
art, whether music, picture, or poem, such technical
achievements have invariably found admirers in any
period of advanced civilisation. It has been said
that these forms display no higher aim than the
verses printed to resemble an hour-glass or altar, in
some of our early poets; but such an accusation is
hardly worthy of serious reply. If the sonnet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>
Italian form has gained world-wide fame, the principle
of fixed form is at once shown to be acceptable to the
majority of scholars, and it becomes only a question of
degree whether these rondeaus and ballades gain so
prominent a place. It is hardly fair to expect to find
among these forms a lyric that has caught the ear of
the public, and won its way to the hearts of everyone;
fifteen years of use is all they may claim, and compared
with the lyric poetry guileless of bonds, during the same
period, they at least hold their own. It must also be
remembered that they were adopted by the younger
men, who won no small amount of their present fame
by these pretty devices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On the Rules of the Various Forms.</span>&mdash;There are
several general laws governing these fixed metrical
forms that must be insisted on at the outset. The
rule of the limited number of rhymes holds good of
nearly all. One feature prominent in the French rules
is impossible in English, as the difference between the
rhyme masculine on words that have not the <i>e</i> mute for
their final letter, and the rhyme feminine on words that
possess the <i>e</i> mute, is unknown to us; but side by side
with the release from one binding law in French verse, a
new one is imposed. In that language, words of exactly
similar <i>sound</i> and <i>spelling</i> may be used to rhyme
together, provided the meaning of the words is distinct&mdash;such
license the most doggerel bard would reject
in English&mdash;in spite of the precedent Milton offers,
having "Ruth" and "ruth" in one of his sonnets.
Purists forbid in our tongue the use of words of distinct
spelling, but identical sound, as "sail" and "sale,"
"bear" and "bare;" nor would they allow words
closely allied, as "claim," "disclaim," "reclaim," to be
employed, the strict rule being, <i>that no syllable once used
as a rhyme can be used again for that purpose throughout
the poem, not even if it be spelt differently while keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>
the same sound; nor if the whole word is altered by a
prefix; the syllable that rhymes must always be a new
one both in sense and sound</i>. It is this feature of the
many rhymes to be found on a limited root-sound that
proves the initial difficulty in these shapes.</p>

<p>If the above rule is thought too strict&mdash;and it must
be owned very few writers acknowledge it to the extent
of excluding such words as "claim, acclaim, prove, reprove,"
etc.&mdash;at least such words should be kept as far
apart as possible, not used in the same stanza, if it can
be avoided, and never to rhyme with one another.
Next in order, but of equal, perhaps primary importance,
is the use of the refrain. This recurrent phrase is common
in many languages; but the way these ballades,
rondeaus, and other shapes employ it, differs from all
others. In most old ballads and folk-songs the refrain
comes as a mere jingle, or, at best, an interlude, not
reflecting the idea of the verse it closes, nor varying its
sense in spite of retaining its sound, as it does in a perfect
example of these forms. An ordinary refrain in other
poetry is usually kept to one note resounding through
the whole poem, much as the drone-bass in "pifferari"
or "musette" music is kept going throughout. In
music there is another form of bass always kept continuous&mdash;the
ground-bass, on which Handel and Bach
built some mighty choruses; but in this the repeated
sequence of notes in the phrase, although they occur
again and again unaltered, have the superstructure
welded into them, one splendid harmony&mdash;not, as in
the other, a melody merely floating over the accompaniment
of the one note or chord of the drone bass.
It may be a somewhat forced parallel, but in the
instance quoted, and the fugue, canon, and other contrapuntal
laws of classical music, there is much in common
with these laws of strict metrical verse. The enormous
use of set forms in the masterpieces of tone-art may be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>
happy augury to the future that yet awaits them in
word-art. It may be said that at present the poems
dare claim no such success as the contrapuntal devices
in music can show, where the greatest works employ
such devices frequently; yet the leap from the simple
forms of counterpoint to the works of the mighty
John Sebastian took but comparatively few years,
although the distance was so great. But fanciful
parallels of this sort are rarely satisfactory to any,
except their maker, and need not be dwelt on here.
The refrain in each case is noticed more especially among
the laws of each form, but with regard to all the forms
it is necessary to insist on the importance of introducing
it unaltered in sound on each recurrence; it is sometimes
changed by using, say, "and" for "but," or "then"
for "if;" but, without condemning any who take this
license, it is better to avoid it. Still, any change of
meaning that be obtained by alteration of punctuation,
accent, or even of spelling, provided the sound is unchanged,
is not merely allowable but desirable, in
lighter verse especially. Without recommending the
use of the pun pure and simple, where its easy vulgarity
would quickly be fatal to the dainty conceits that mark
the best humorous verse in these forms, yet any pretty
play upon words, or a sentence with new meaning read
into it by the context, is more than permissible, being
present in the best models of the Voiture rondeau and
many triolets and ballades. This applies chiefly to
poems of the class called <i>Vers de Soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>, for want of an
English synonym. The comic papers of our own
country show no use of the form quite so fine in burlesque
treatment as some of the American ones, notably the
chant royal, <i>Mrs. Jones</i>, by Mr. H. C. Bunner; in
the burlesque examples printed in this book it will be
seen that the forms can be made to give added zest to
satire or humour, beside imparting a certain scholarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>
finish, that itself raises them from the terribly dead
level of much of our so-called comic poetry. A few
shapes yet await presentation in English dress. I have
not succeeded in finding specimens of the <i>glose</i> or the
<i>virelai</i> (rhythme d'Alain Chartier), while the example
of the <i>virelai</i> (<i>nouveau</i>), Mr. Dobson's "July,"
is the only one brought to light. The <i>lai</i> and the
<i>rondelet</i> are also very little used, so that anyone
interested in these old measures will yet find plenty
of unhackneyed forms for experimenting upon. It is
curious that the sonnet, no less exacting in its technical
rules, and far more imperious in the treatment it
demands, finds so many eager followers, for with its
wealth of literature, the chance of attaining to the
second rank even, among such splendid poems, requires
a high amount of talent, if not absolute genius. In the
rondeau, or ballade, many writers who are ignored in the
ampler crowd of sonnet-makers might find pleasing
forms, not merely to display true poetic thoughts (if
they have the power to do so), but verse that has in its
shape some air of novelty still, and would sound less like
the faint re-echoes of a stronger song, the frequent effect
of many a modern sonnet.</p>

<p>These few prefatory lines may well close with De
Banville's own words (in Mr. Lang's English)&mdash;"This
cluster of forms is one of our most precious treasures,
for each of them forms a rhythmic whole, complete
and perfect, while at the same time they all possess
the fresh and unconscious grace which marks the
production of primitive times." As the translator adds,
"There is some truth in this criticism, for it is a mark
of man's early ingenuity in many arts to seek complexity
(where you would expect simplicity), and yet to
lend to that complexity an infantine naturalness. One
can see this phenomenon in early decorative art, and
in early law and custom, and even in the complicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>
structure of primitive languages. Now, just as early
and even savage races are our masters in the decorative
use of colour and of carving, so the nameless mastersingers
of ancient France may be our teachers in
decorative poetry&mdash;the poetry some call <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>."</p>

<p>In analysing the structure of these forms, it would
be, no doubt, possible for a master to present them in
English, as terse and epigrammatic as the French of
de Banville or de Gramont. But there would be a
danger in so doing. A famous prelate is said to have
apologised for a long letter, on the ground that he had
not time to write a short one: this anecdote may be
paraphrased here, for it often happens that many have
time to run through a discursive, gossipy description,
when they could not devote the attention needful to
<i>read</i> a short one. If every word is carefully chosen,
and used in an exact way to convey as much as possible,
it requires no less careful reading;&mdash;as in some of our
Science Primers, where the material for an ordinary
chapter is condensed and reduced to the crystal of a
single sentence, that demands almost equal exactness
in obtaining its solution, if one would absorb all the
learning compressed in so small a compass. This excuse
may serve in lieu of a better for the somewhat prolix
method in which these rules are presented. Let no one
imagine that the most perfect knowledge of the laws
of these forms is enough to start him in writing poetry;
for such rules are but what the fundamental rules of
arithmetic are to astronomers&mdash;all important as the
basis, but powerless, without genius and science, to
discover new worlds, or formulate an hypothesis for the
existence of known ones. If such books as those the
present chapter follows are looked upon as handbooks
to making <i>poetry</i>, that one stupendous flight of imagination
is probably the only one its author is fated to
achieve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Ballade.</span>&mdash;In the alphabetical sequence adopted
in the arrangement of this volume, the <i>Ballade</i> happily
comes first. This is as it should be, since no other of
these forms has been more frequently used in English,
nor, it may be, is any other so capable of variety,
since among its successful examples many different
treatments will be found. This form adapts itself to
its subject, and may be sonorous or stately, playful
or easy, at the will of its writer, as, in capable hands,
it can strike any note in the gamut of passions, from
religious exaltation or fierce grim satire, to actual
pathos, or, if needful, pure burlesque. It is possible
the <i>Ballade</i> will never be written so strictly to one
model as the sonnet, but that many variations&mdash;to be
noticed presently&mdash;will each find admirers; but the
existing examples warrant a belief that the shape will
continue in our poetry, for it is impossible, in face of
many hundred examples, to style it an exotic at the
present day.</p>

<p>The construction of the <i>Ballade</i>, although not less
stern in insisting on the introduction of a refrain than
many of the other shapes, uses it at wider intervals,
and so escapes the besetting danger of such forms as the
<i>villanelle</i> or <i>triolet</i>, where its constant recurrence may
easily become as senseless as the "with a fal, la, la" of
the old madrigal writers, unless it be very skilfully
brought in. Again, its length, generally of twenty-eight
or thirty-five lines, with the refrain in either case
appearing but four times, allows room to display the
subject, and yet forbids the diffuseness of many ordinary
lyrics, where one fancies a happy rhyme-sound is often
responsible for the intrusion of an additional couplet or
quatrain, that weakens the whole poem. Its length,
moreover, strictly within hard and fast limits though it
be, is not so cramped as the fourteen lines of the true
sonnet, nor has tradition fixed the style of treatment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span>
the central idea. The narrative ballade is perfectly
legitimate, provided the writer has sufficient power to
overcome the extreme difficulty it presents. It is often
urged that the unalterable sequence of rhymes, which
must be found after the set of three or five are
once chosen, proves a hindrance to the imagination of
the poet who uses it. M. Lem&acirc;itre has answered this
objection very aptly. He says&mdash;"The poet who begins
a ballade does not know very exactly what he will put
into it. The rhyme, and nothing but the rhyme, will
whisper things unexpected and charming, things he
would never have thought of but for her, things with
strange and remote relations to each other, all united in
the disorder of a dream. Nothing, indeed, is richer in
suggestion than the strict laws of these difficult pieces;
they force the fancy to wander afield, hunting high and
low; and while she seeks through all the world the foot
that can wear Cinderella's slipper, she makes delightful
discoveries by the way."<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ballade</span>, in its normal type, consists of three
stanzas of eight lines, followed by a verse of four lines,
known as the envoy, or three verses of ten lines, with
envoy of five, each of the stanzas and the envoy closing
with the refrain. The most important rules for the
ballade may be put briefly:&mdash;<i>First</i>, The same set of
rhymes in the same order they occupy in the first stanza
must repeat throughout the whole of its verses.
<i>Secondly</i>, No word once used as a rhyme must be used
again for that purpose in the whole length of the poem.
<i>Thirdly</i>, Each stanza and the envoy must close with the
refrain; the envoy always taking the same rhymes as
the last half of the preceding verse, in the same order.
For the eight-lined ballade, but three rhymes are
allowable. In ordinary rhyme formula the sequence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>these is A, B, A, B, B, C, B, C, for each of the three verses,
and B, C, B, C, for the envoy. The importance of the
refrain must now be noticed. Old writers and purists of
our own time insist that the length of the refrain should
govern not only the length of each line, but the number
of the lines; in other words, that a refrain of eight
syllables involves the choice of an eight-lined stanza,
while the refrain of ten syllables demands a ten-lined
verse. This is the strict rule of the ballade as written
by Clement Marot, and by some modern writers; but
it must be clearly understood that it is only the
rule for the ideally pure form, and that variations in
this respect are perfectly allowable. Now the importance
of the refrain in one aspect is given, a still
more vital point must be named&mdash;namely, that the
sense of the refrain must be supreme throughout the
ballade, the culminating line of each stanza always
brought in without effort as the natural close of the
verse. In the verses a special feature must not be overlooked,
namely, that the stanza (of eight or ten lines, as the
case may be) should carry an unbroken sense throughout,
and not split into two verses of four lines or five
lines, that are by chance printed as though they were
one. The needful pauses for punctuation are of course
allowed, but the sense should not finish at the end of
the first quatrain (or quintain), but demand the rest of
the verse to complete the idea presented. All these
apparently trivial details must be regarded if the ballade
is attempted. The advice given in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>,
"Take care of the sense and the sounds will take
care of themselves," whether in that way or its inversion,
"Take care of the sounds and the sense will take care of
itself," is exactly the direct opposite of the true rule.
Neither sense nor sound may be scamped here. If you
neglect the sounds it is no ballade; if you neglect the
sense&mdash;why write it at all? No one is compelled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span>
use these complex forms, but if chosen, their laws
must be obeyed to the letter if success is to be attained.
The chief pleasure they yield consists in the apparent
spontaneity, which is the result of genius, if genius be
indeed the art of taking infinite pains; or, if that
definition is rejected, they must yet exhibit the art
which conceals art, whether by intense care in every
minute detail, or a happy faculty for naturally wearing
these fetters. The dance in chains must be skilful, the
chains worn as decorative adjuncts, and the whole with
as much apparent ease as the unfettered dancer could
produce, or woe betide the unlucky wight who attempts
to perform in them.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Envoy</span> is so peculiarly a feature of the Ballade
and Chant Royal, that it is needful to draw our attention
to the invocation which with it invariably commences.
Of old this envoy was really addressed to the patron
of the poet, or at least to the high dignitary to
whom he dedicated his ballade. So that we find
Prince! or Princess! Sire! or some mythical or
symbolical personality invoked in the opening word.
Often the person chosen was in very truth a noble
of the rank assigned, but the custom of opening
the envoy in this fashion grew so common that it
lost its special fitness, and was often employed as a
conventional ascription to those not of noble rank, while
in some instances all the lovers' ballades intended for
their own ladies were yet ascribed by the poets to the
"Princess" of the court, who quite understood the
fiction employed, and accepted praise of the golden hair
and blue eyes of the rightful owner of the poem, while
possibly her royal tresses were black and her eyes brown.
In the number of ballades included in this collection the
larger number will still be found to follow the old custom,
which is so marked that the use of this dedication
certainly carries out the spirit of the poem, in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span>
with its original design. The envoy is not only
a dedication, but should be the peroration of the
subject, and richer in its wording and more stately
in its imagery than the preceding verses, to convey
the climax of the whole matter, and avoid the
suspicion that it is a mere postscript, as it were, to
the ballade.</p>

<p>In the ballade with stanzas of ten lines, usually of
ten syllables each, four rhymes are permitted in this
order&mdash;A, B, A, B, B, C, C, D, C, D, with C, C, D, C,
D for the envoy. It is not needful to quote examples, or
describe varieties with eight or ten-lined stanzas, that
have lines of equal or unequal length, but in other respects
follow all the true rules. De Gramont has observed that
the strict laws of the <i>ballade</i> belong more to the prosodists
who studied the form after it had ceased to be in current
use, and that the writers of the <i>ballade</i> themselves
frequently took great liberty. In some by Marot there
are verses of eleven or twelve decasyllabic lines, and
in poets who preceded him, some with thirteen and
fourteen lines to the stanza, while the number of
verses has also been flagrantly disregarded, some even
using four or five verses, and still worse, having different
rhymes to them; but in such cases the poem must not
be regarded as an irregular ballade, nor a ballade at all,
but simply as a set of verses with refrain.</p>

<p>The <i>Ballade with double refrain</i>, of which the "Frere
Lubin" of Clement Marot is the only well-known
example in old French, is said by Thomas Sibilet, in
his <i>Art Po&eacute;tique</i>, 1555, to be "<i>autant rare que
plaisante</i>." Its point of difference is that a second
refrain is introduced at the fourth line of each
stanza, and the second of the envoy. This necessarily
alters the order of the rhymes of the envoy. In the
best known English example the rhyme order is
A, B, A, B, B, C, B, C, with B, B, C, C, for the envoy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span>
There are several in modern English, and some in
recent French.</p>

<p>The <i>Double Ballade</i> consists of six stanzas of eight
or ten lines, and is written usually without an envoy.
The "Ballade of Dead Lions," in <i>London</i>, January 12,
1878, was the first English specimen; it is not quoted
here, as its subject is now out of date. De Banville has
written several. "<i>Pour les bonnes gens</i>," "<i>Des sottises de
Paris</i>" are two in his "<i>Trente-six Ballades Joyeuses</i>"
written in this form.</p>

<p>M. de Banville humorously reveals a secret of the
poet's workshop, and gives a method to construct a
"correct" ballade in a mechanical fashion, dispensing
with genius, and easy to work&mdash;First, at one sitting
write the last half of all the verses, and at another
time the first half, then join them together, and the
result will be an irremediably bad ballade; but elsewhere
he writes, in all seriousness this time, "All the
art is to bring in the refrain without effort, naturally,
gaily, and at each time with novel effect and with
fresh light cast on the central idea. 'Now you can'
teach 'no one to do that, and M. de Banville never
pretends to give any receipts for cooking <i>rondels</i> or
<i>ballades</i> worth reading.' Without poetic vision all is
mere marqueterie and cabinetmaker's work; that is, so
far as poetry is concerned, nothing."<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chant Royal</span> is now accepted by most writers as
merely a larger form of the ballade, written with five
verses of eleven lines, and envoi of five. De Gramont
treats the idea to regard it as a distinct form as a mere
fanciful attempt of prosodists, founded chiefly on the
fact that Clement Marot has left four so named which
conform to the above rule; but he shows that on the one
hand there are ballades with stanzas of eleven lines, and
on the other chants royal with ten only. It has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span>
suggested that the <i>Chant Royal</i> derived its name from
the subjects that are more usually dedicated to its use;
but while these are generally sublime topics treated in
dignified allegory, yet there are examples extant entirely
devoid of these characteristics. Again, the idea that it
owes its name to being a form selected for competition
before the king for the dignity of laureate, and hence
dubbed royal-song, he also rejects, and points out that
its name simply denotes that it is the most excellent
form of the ballade (as we might say, the "king of ballades"
in English), one that, from the increased length,
both in stanzas and number of lines in each, largely
augments the difficulties of construction met with in the
true ballade, and marks it as "the final <i>tour de force</i> of
poetic composition." Henry de Cro&iuml; derives the title of
this form from the fact that persons excelling in the
composition of chants royal were worthy to be
crowned with garlands like conquerors and kings. It is
a moot point with students whether the ballade or
chant royal is the earlier and original poem. The
chant royal in the old form is usually devoted to the
unfolding of an allegory in its five stanzas, the envoy
supplying the key; but this is not always observed in
modern examples. Whatever be the subject, however, it
must always march in stately rhythm with splendid
imagery, using all the poetic adornments of sonorous,
highly-wrought lines and rich embroidery of words to
clothe a theme in itself a lofty one. Unless the whole
poem is constructed with intense care, and has intrinsic
beauty of its own of no mean order, the monotony of its
sixty-one lines rhymed on five sounds is unbearable. In
spite of the increased burden imposed by the necessity
of so many similar rhymes, no shadow of "poetic" or
other license must be taken. Nothing short of complete
success can warrant the choice of this exacting form,
which demands all that can be given to it; enriched with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>
all the elaboration of consummate art in its every detail,
and rising stanza by stanza, until the climax is reached
in the envoy.</p>

<p>The laws of the ballade apply to the chant royal, with
some added details of its own. The rhyme order is
usually&mdash;a, b, a, b, c, c, d, d, e, d, e, with envoy of
d, d, e, d, e. An example by Deschamps, "<i>Sur le mort
du Seigneur de Coucy</i>," observes this order, a, b, a, b,
b, c, c, d, c, d, and envoy, c, c, d, c, c, d. In either
case the rhyme-order must be kept the same for each
stanza, and the envoy commenced with an invocation as
in the old ballades.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chain Verse.</span>&mdash;There is one beautiful poem in so-called
chain verse, which has so much likeness to these
once-exotic forms that it deserves quotation in full, if
only as an example of a native specimen of poetic
ingenuity. It has little affinity with the chain verse of
French art, as then the one word only grew from each
line into the other (La rime Encha&icirc;n&eacute;e).</p>

<p>This has so many points resembling the forms in this
book, that it seemed worth quoting, if only to compare
with the Malay Pantoum, the Villanelle, and the Rondel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kyrielle.</span>&mdash;The <i>Kyrielle</i> is so simple, and so widely
used by writers, all unwittingly, that but for M.
de Banville including it, it would be left unnoticed
here. It is merely a poem in four-lined verses
of eight-syllable lines, having the last line of each
the same. Our hymn books show many, witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span>
"Jesus! Son of Mary, hear," or "Jesus, our Love, is
crucified." It is a device so evident that it has naturally
been used in almost all schools of poetry, and may be
dismissed with no more words here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pantoum.</span>&mdash;The <i>Pantoum</i>, at first sight, has little
reason for being included in a volume of verse in strict
traditional forms, that are nearly all of French origin,
since it is of Malay invention; but being introduced by
M. Ernest Fouinet, and reproduced by M. Victor Hugo
in the <i>Orientales</i>, it has found a place in the group
of these forms given by De Banville, De Gramont, and
others. The Pantoum is written in four-line stanzas.
The second and fourth line of each verse form the first
and third of each succeeding one, through an indefinite
number of quatrains. At the close, to complete the
unity of the work, the second and fourth line of the last
stanza are made from the first and third of the first
verse. The rhymes are a b, a b,&mdash;b c, b c,&mdash;c d, c d,&mdash;d
e, d e, and so on, until the last (which we may call
z) z a, z a. In Mr. Austin Dobson's "In Town" and
Mr. Brander Matthews' "En route"&mdash;as the latter himself
points out in <i>The Rhymester</i>&mdash;"there is an
attempt to make the constant repetitions not merely
tolerable but subservient to the general effect of
monotonously recurrent sound&mdash;in the one case the
buzzing of the fly, and in the other the rattle and strain
of the cars."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Rondel, Rondeau</span>, and <span class="smcap">Roundel</span>, a group having
a common origin, are now to some extent classified, by
each accepted variety using one form of the common
name to denote its shape, but this division is purely
arbitrary and a modern custom, only followed here, both
in these notes and in the arrangement of the volume
itself, to facilitate reference.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Rondel</span> is merely the old form of the word
rondeau; like <i>oisel</i> for <i>oiseau</i>, <i>chastel</i> for <i>chateau</i> so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span>
<i>rondel</i> has become <i>rondeau</i>. It is one of the earliest of
these forms, and freely used in the fourteenth century
by Froissart, Eustache Deschamps, and others. It
probably arose in Provence, and passed afterwards
into use in Northern France. The name (rondel) is
still applied to forms written after its early shape,
the later spelling of the name being kept for the more
recent variations of its form. In its origin, the rondel
was a lyric of two verses, each having four or five
lines, rhyming on two rhymes only. In its eight (or ten)
lines, but five (or six) were distinct, the others being
made by repeating the first couplet at the end of the
second stanza, sometimes in an inverse order, and the
first line at the end of its first stanza. The eight-lined
rondel is thus, to all intents and purposes, a triolet,
although labelled a rondel. Here is a fourteenth
century one by Eustache Deschamps:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Est ce donc vostre intencion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De voloir retrancher mes gaiges<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vingt livres de ma pension?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Est-ce donc vostre intencion?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laissez passer l'Ascension,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que honni soit vostre visaige!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Est-ce donc vostre intencion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De voloir retrancher mes gaiges?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nor are these rondel-triolets exceptions; they are quite
common till the beginning of the fifteenth century.
With Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans the rondel took the distinct
shape we now assign to it, namely, of fourteen lines on
two rhymes, the first two lines repeating for the seventh
and eighth, and the final couplet (see page <a href="#Page_135">135</a>). In this,
the true type of the rondel, the two-lined refrain
occurring three times in its fourteen makes it an
unwieldy form to handle. In later French ones the last
refrain uses but one of its lines. In Mr. Austin Dobson's
"The Wanderer," the rhymes are in this order:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span><span class="smcap">A.</span>
<span class="smcap">B.</span> b. a.&mdash;a. b. <span class="smcap">A.</span> <span class="smcap">B.</span>&mdash;a. b. b. a. A. (the refrain being
marked by capital letters). In another by the same
author, "How hard it is to Sing," the rhyme order
is <span class="smcap">A.</span> <span class="smcap">B.</span> a. b.&mdash;b. a. <span class="smcap">A.</span> <span class="smcap">B.</span>&mdash;a. b. a. b. <span class="smcap">A.</span> <span class="smcap">B.</span>; the rondel
of Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans having <span class="smcap">A.</span> <span class="smcap">B.</span> b. a. a. b. <span class="smcap">A.</span> <span class="smcap">B.</span>&mdash;a.
b. b. a. <span class="smcap">A.</span> <span class="smcap">B.</span> The length of the lines is not confined
to any particular number of syllables in modern
examples.</p>

<p>By the time of Octavien de Saint Gelais (1466-1502) the
rondel has nearly become the rondeau as we know it.
Still rhymed on but two sounds, it repeats the first line
only, nor always the whole of that, as the quoted
examples show:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Here it is formally divided into three parts with the
rhymes&mdash;a, b, b, a; a, b, a; a, b, b, a, a. The refrain,
too, is no longer a mere reiteration of the text, but
linked with the preceding verse, as a refrain should be,
and absorbed into the sense of the whole stanza to
which it belongs. This change is still more noticeable in
the rondel, using but half the first line for its refrain,
as in this example:&mdash;</p>

<p>Here we pass into the later form called (for convenience
only) the <i>Rondeau</i>. In these few examples the
evolution of the <i>Voiture</i> type, from the Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans
original, is clearly traceable. The rondel, however, still
continues to be used, but much less frequently. De
Banville often omits the thirteenth line, while otherwise
following the model of Charles d'Orl&eacute;ans. Again,
the order of the rhymes is sometimes changed, but the
examples quoted in this collection will show more clearly
the deviations from the true rondel than any description
would do.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Rondeau</span> after Voiture's model is without
doubt the most popular variety of the form now in
use. It is written throughout on two rhymes, being
composed of thirteen lines and two unrhymed refrains.
The lines are now nearly always of eight syllables only,
in many of the old ones they were of ten. The refrain
is usually made from the first half of the first line, but
it is not uncommon to find the first word only taken for
this use. Its thirteen lines are grouped in three stanzas,
the first and third having five lines each, the second
consisting of three only. The refrain occurs at the end
of the second stanza, and at the close of the poem. The
usual rhyme order is a, a, b, b, a,&mdash;&mdash;a, a, b (and
refrain)&mdash;a, a, b, b, a, and refrain. The refrain is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a></span>
counted among the lines of the verse, but is added to
the thirteen, and in the neatness of its introduction,
and in the way each of the two verses to which it belongs
flow into it, so that it forms an integral and inseparable
part of the stanza, the chief difficulty of the rondeau
lies. If, like an "Amen" to a hymn, the refrain comes
merely as an extraneous comment on the preceding
lines, it is no true rondeau. At the risk of reiteration
of a warning given in the description of each of these
poems that use a refrain, this point must be insisted on,
as the most vital one. The mechanical laws of the
poem may be obeyed with scrupulous exactitude, and every
technical rule complied with, while the still more important
quality of sense is overlooked. The thought of
the poet must so find its expression that the refrain
completes it, and forms the true climax of his
speech&mdash;the culminating phrase of his sentence. The
refrain is the very text of the whole discourse, in itself
an epitome of the subject of the whole poem, otherwise
the reason for its existence in one of these fixed shapes
is wanting, and the poem would be better in free verse.
In the refrain the sound must reappear exactly, but the
sense may be altered; in fact, this playful variation of
its meaning is one of the charms of the verse when used
for lighter and more dainty subjects. The good taste of
the author must decide how far an actual pun is allowable.
There are precedents for the use of the pun pure and
simple&mdash;"votre beau th&eacute;" "v&ograve;tre beaut&eacute;," or, "&agrave; la
fontaine," used in its literal sense, and also with reference
to the famous fabulist. But in English use the pun
has fallen into disrepute, perhaps from the execrable
word-contortions of our so-called comic papers and its
terrible vulgarity in stage burlesques, the intrusion of
one is fatal to the delicacy and refinement which are the
peculiar charm of the rondeau. But if a play upon
words of a scholarly kind, or a new reading given either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[Pg lxii]</a></span>
by punctuation, or the use of the words with a new
light thrown on them by the lines leading up to the
refrain, can be secured, every effort should be made to
vary the refrain by so doing.</p>

<p>This quality of dainty and spontaneous wit is the
secret of the rondeau, only revealed, if it is to be found
at all, by close analysis of the best examples. De
Banville quotes three of Voiture's&mdash;"Je ne s&ccedil;aurois,"
"L'Amour," and "Penser"&mdash;especially for this all-important
feature; but in this volume may be found
examples equally worthy of study. It would be
invidious to draw attention to the best of those that
have been allowed to appear here, but if the wit of
the would-be rondeau-maker fails to discover the successful
use of the refrain, and to pick out the best examples,
it is in itself evidence that he had better abstain from
trying to produce rondeaus that would certainly lack
the airy grace and caressing tenderness which should
be an element of this verse. A famous example of
Voiture's is quoted on page <a href="#Page_134">134</a>.</p>

<p>A study of rondeaus will show, both in ancient and
modern examples, some little alteration of the rhyme-order,
and a few trivial differences in other respects.
But as the sonnet has evolved through many stages
into one accepted shape that is now permanently fixed
as its true type, so the rondeau of Voiture may be taken
as the typical form to be imitated&mdash;the one that has, by
process of selection, been proved to be the best to display
the subject of the poem, and to work-in the refrains
to the best advantage. Like the sonnet, the perfected
form is jealously guarded. The genius which consists
in breaking rules is looked upon with suspicion in all
these forms, but especially in this one. There are some
beautiful variations in old and new examples where the
shape is widely varied, but these stand apart from the
pure rondeaus of Voiture, and are generally still more
difficult to construct by reason of the additional laws
the writers have imposed on themselves. But the trifling
evasion of the rhyme-order, a want of exactitude on
the repetition of the refrain, is apt to be taken as
evidence of lack of power to conform gracefully to the
bonds, and not as an outburst of genius that is too
strong to be confined in such puny fetters. But there
are a few <i>poems</i> in these forms written fairly near the
true shape, which, like some irregular, but yet in themselves
beautiful sonnets, are not to be condemned solely
for being impure in form. For the sake of poetry one
is ready to forgive much, but it must be only real <i>poetry</i>
that takes such liberty; and all the time comes a wish
that having gone so near perfection of shape as well as
of sense, the poet had taken the last steps needful to
make his poem perfect in each respect.</p>

<p>There is another form than Voiture's, which is
equally a true rondeau&mdash;that used by Villon. This is
quoted, with Mr. Payne's translation, to show clearly the
ten-lined rondeau:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">&mdash;<i>John Payne.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Austin Dobson's <i>Rose</i>, which appeared in <i>The
Spectator</i>, was one of the earliest, if not the very first, of
the few examples of this variety in English use.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Roundel</span>, which, it must again be said, is simply
a variation of the rondeau, and not a distinct form, is
grouped apart in this collection for the sake of convenience.
Since Mr. Swinburne devoted a volume, entitled
<i>A Century of Roundels</i>, to this particular form of the
rondeau, it has been used by other writers, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[Pg lxv]</a></span>
name applied by him has been kept by those who chose
to follow the same form. Probably Mr. Swinburne,
during his readings in early French poetry, found poems
of this shape extant, or it may be that, for reasons of his
own, he formulated this variety, which slightly differs from
any I have been able to find. In Marot's <i>De l'Amoureux
Ardant</i> there is a likeness to this shape, and in Villon's
<i>Mort</i> there is also a resemblance, but Mr. Swinburne's
roundel has eleven lines always, while Villon's has
twelve, rhyming a.b.b. a.a.b. refrain, a.b.b.a. refrain.
Again, Mr. Swinburne's roundel not only has a new
rhyme order, A.B.A. refrain; B.A.B.; A.B.A. refrain;
but when the refrain consists of more than a single word
it rhymes with the B lines. The rhythm, too, of Mr.
Swinburne's are in every possible and&mdash;in any hands but
his&mdash;impossible variety. The lines vary from four to
sixteen syllables, but are generally identical in length in
the same roundel. As an experiment in rhythm the
<i>Century of Roundels</i> will, no doubt, always command
attention, and there are not wanting signs that his
<i>Roundel</i>, keeping its length and other details, may
become a recognised shape in English verse; but it
must be distinctly understood that Mr. Swinburne is
responsible for its introduction, and to him, not to the
early French poets, must be awarded the honour of its
invention, unless he himself refers it to an earlier source
for its authority; but it may be that with admiration
for the old shapes, he yet saw that for English use a
variation was preferable, and so rearranged the lines
and the refrain of the olden form in the way he considered
best suited to our tongue.</p>

<p>The <i>Rondelet</i> is a little form not noticed in De
Gramont or De Banville. Boulmier has printed several
in his "Po&eacute;sies en language du XVe. Si&egrave;cle" at the
end of his volume, entitled <i>Les Villanelles</i>. Here is
one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[Pg lxvi]</a></span></p>

<p>Here we find he adopts a seven-line stanza with four
eight-syllable lines, and three of four syllables on two
rhymes, a, b, a, a, b, b, a. While strongly resembling
the triolet and the early rondel, it yet seems worth
noting as a pretty variety for trifling subjects. There
are several in English verse.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Rondeau Redoubl&eacute;</span> would fail to suggest
kinship with either form of the Rondeau, did not it
include the name in its designation, as De Banville
notes. It is probable that many more poems were
grouped under the word Rondeau than we now are able
to trace. The one we are now describing is in no way
a doubled rondeau, and hardly suggests that form more
than any of these that have the features of limited
rhyme sounds, and more or less frequent reiteration of
a refrain. The Rondeau Redoubl&eacute; is written in six
octosyllabic quatrains, rhyming on two alternate rhymes,
with half the initial line used (unrhymed) after the last
verse. Its one distinctive feature is this:&mdash;Each line of
the first quatrain is used again in the same order to
serve for the last line of verses two, three, four, and
five; while the last line of the sixth has a new wording
for itself, but takes, in addition, a final refrain of the
first half of the initial line of the poem to conclude the
whole. As the rhymes of the first quatrain are a. b. a. b.,
it must necessarily&mdash;to use as refrain the first line
rhyming on <i>a</i>&mdash;reverse the order for the second verse,
which is therefore b. a. b. a., and so on alternately until
the end of the rondeau redoubl&eacute;. Specimens of its use
are extant by Marot, La Fontaine, Benserade, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[Pg lxvii]</a></span>
others, while in modern French it is not infrequent, but
in English it is rare. The examples quoted in this
book comprise all that diligent search could discover
except one of too fugitive a character to reprint.
As the poems written in this form in English
show the rules of the verse as plainly as the original
French, it has not been thought needful to quote
one in its native tongue, especially as De Gramont,
De Banville, and Jullien reprint specimens in their
handbooks. A form so simple that, if well wrought, and
the refrain brought in with skill, it can be read in a
casual way, without discovering that it was written to
exact rules, deserves more use. The disposition of the
subject is excellently laid out; a "text," four "divisions,"
and "in conclusion," with the text repeated, is a
method so familiar to Englishmen on Sundays that the
order for variations on the initial theme is peculiarly
easy: nor need the result be the least like a sermon,
although this description of its shape is suggestive of
one.</p>

<p>Another form, the <span class="smcap">Glose</span>, resembles the Rondeau
Redoubl&eacute; in many ways; indeed, it may be almost looked
upon as a freer form of that poem. It appears, however,
to be of distinct origin, and very rare in French poetry,
although much used in Spanish and Portuguese verse.
It begins, like the Rondeau Redoubl&eacute;, with a quatrain,
here called the <i>texte</i>;&mdash;this is usually a quotation
from a former poet. This text the Glose proceeds to
comment on, or amplify, in four stanzas of ten lines,
closing each as in the rondeau redoubl&eacute;, with one of
the lines of the text in the original order; but the
necessity for restricting the rhymes to two is not
observed here. Each stanza has the sixth, ninth, and
tenth (the refrain) line, rhyming on the same sound,
but the others appear to be chosen at the fancy of the
writer, while the final refrain of the rondeau redoubl&eacute;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[Pg lxviii]</a></span>
is also wanting in the glose. First employed solely
for serious themes of religion or philosophy, it is now in
France, like the once sacred triolet, devoted to parody
and the lightest forms of humour. Owing to the
impossibility of collating the mass of periodical literature
of the last ten or fifteen years, it would be rash
to say that the <i>glose</i> has never appeared in English, but
not one has been discovered to include in this book. Yet,
as De Gramont places the shape among those he includes
as frequently used in France, it seemed best to give
here a brief outline of its form. De Banville quotes
one by Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Sarazin formed on the sonnet "de
IOB" by Benserade, where fourteen quatrains are ended
by the lines of the sonnet, employed in their original
order. This form offers a field for serious comment or
sarcastic parody that deserves working.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sestina</span>, invented by the famous troubadour,
Arnaut Daniel, at the end of the thirteenth century,
has not been used in French poetry so often as the
ballade and rondeau. There are specimens in the poetry
of Pontus de Thyard, and one in the Pleiade of the
sixteenth century, besides many others, but it has been
comparatively an exotic in French poetry, as in
English, until recent years. That it was used and
admired by Dante and Petrarch, alone gives the sestina
a royal precedence over all of the other forms. Many
judges consider it to be the supreme work of poetic art
in fixed forms, while others claim similar distinction for
the chant royal, and not a few for the sonnet. To
distinguish between the charms of these three royal forms
would need a Paris, nor is it necessary to do so, since
each will to his own taste, no matter who claims authority
on the ever-disputed question of supreme beauty.
Mr. Hueffer in his "Troubadours" has a chapter so
full of interest and teeming with information of the
growth of the stanza, that in despair of condensing its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[Pg lxix]</a></span>
knowledge within the space possible here, the mere
notice of it must suffice. De Gramont give the rules
of the poem as written by the originator and followers
in Italy, Spain, and Portugal:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st.&mdash;The Sestina has six stanzas, each of six lines,
these being of the same length.</p>

<p>2nd.&mdash;The lines of the six verses end with the
six same words, not rhyming with each other; these
end words are chosen exclusively from two syllabled
nouns.</p>

<p>3rd.&mdash;The arrangement of these six terminal words
follows a regular law (a somewhat complex one, which
is replaced in modern poetry by the one given
below).</p>

<p>4th.&mdash;The piece closes with a three-line stanza, using
the six words, three at the end; the other three, placed
in the middle of its lines.</p>

<p>But, as now written, the words of the sestina at times
rhyme with each other; if so, De Banville says they
should be in two rhymes alone (as Mr. Swinburne uses
them), but other writers allow three rhymes. But these
details all belong to the subtle laws of the verse which
it is not possible to include here. De Gramont's <i>Sestines</i>
is, perhaps, the best authority for study.</p>

<p>For our purpose, enough to say that the six end-words
must repeat unchanged in sound and spelling throughout
each succeeding verse. The order in which they occur
is best expressed by a numerical formula. If the rules
themselves were compressed, a more complex and incomprehensible
jargon of firsts and seconds and thirds, etc.,
could hardly be found. The first verse has, of course,
the initial order, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; the second, 6, 1, 5, 2,
4, 3; the third, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5; the fourth, 5, 3, 2, 6,
1, 4; the fifth, 4, 5, 1, 3, 6, 2; the sixth, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3, 1;
the last half-stanza ends with 2, 4, 6, and uses 1, 3, 5
at the beginning (not the first word always) of the line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[Pg lxx]</a></span>
or at the half-line in rhymes that permit their introduction
there. It will be seen that no end-word occurs
more than once in the same place, and that the end-word
of every stanza is invariably chosen to take its place as
terminal of the first line of the next verse.</p>

<p>As though this feat in rhyming were not complex
enough, a double sestina of twelve verses of twelve lines
has been sometimes written. There are two, at least, of
these <i>tours de force</i> in English&mdash;one, "The Complaint of
Lisa," in Mr. Swinburne's <i>Poems and Ballads</i>, Second
Series; another, by Mr. George Barlow, in <i>A Life's Love</i>,
entitled "Alone." It was hoped to include these, but
the required space in this little book would have
excluded so many specimens of smaller poems, that the
desire to make this collection as widely varied and
representative as possible forbade their quotation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Triolet</span>, as we know it, may be regarded as
almost an epitome of the other forms, in its limited
space. It introduces one refrain three times, and the
second refrain twice, keeps strictly to two rhymes,
and is inflexible in its laws, brief though it be.
One poet says of it, "It is charming&mdash;nothing can
be more ingeniously mischievous, more playfully sly,
than this tiny trill of epigrammatic melody turning
so simply upon its own innocent axis." Those who
are unaware of the rules that govern this little stanza,
yet often fall in love with the verse itself, possibly
because a good example has a pretty sequence of
sound, that allures the ear by its musical jingle,
and reads like a spontaneous and easy impromptu.
Nevertheless, the subtle art needed to acquire the
ease that is the charm of a good triolet is generally
the result of infinite care. Few things are more
simple than to write a triolet&mdash;of a sort&mdash;yet the
triolet affords so little space to explain its motif, and
within its five lines must tell its story, and also carry the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[Pg lxxi]</a></span>
three other repeated ones easily, and with a definite
meaning. To introduce the refrain naturally as the
only thing to say, and yet with an air of freshness and
an unexpected recognition of a phrase heard before, is in
itself no mean difficulty, even in the ballade and rondeau;
but when it comes three times in eight lines, and has a
second line attached to it on its first and last appearance,
it is a matter of small wonder that the successful triolets
are not very numerous. That the ideally perfect
triolet is as yet unwritten, or at least represented by
very few, it may be urged; but if that be true, it should
only provoke more attempts, one would fancy. It might
be pertinent to ask, if this is the chief objection, how
many ideally perfect poems in any set shape, or in free
form, the world acknowledges?</p>

<p>The triolet consists (to quote Mr. Dobson) of <i>eight</i>
lines with <i>two</i> rhymes. The first pair of lines are
repeated as the seventh and eighth, while the first is
repeated as the fourth. The order of the rhymes is thus
as follows:&mdash;a. b. a. a. a. b. a. b. The example (on
page <a href="#Page_214">214</a>) by&mdash;of all persons in the world&mdash;a grave French
magistrate, Jacques Ranchin, has been christened by
M&eacute;nage the "King of <i>Triolets</i>."</p>

<p>The first triolet known is in the Cl&eacute;omad&eacute;s of Aden&egrave;z-le-Roi
(1258-1297), a poem of 20,000 verses. In old
examples the triolet was devoted to grave verse, but, as
M. de Gramont shows, it has now not only abandoned
the old ten syllable lines, and is written in those of
eight and often six syllables, but from the elegiac
dignity of its former subjects, it has become in French
verse the form especially devoted to the most ephemeral
and trivial subjects. Since M. de Banville renewed its
use, triolets are common in French newspapers, and
with all due deference be it said&mdash;possibly only thereby
exposing my own ignorance of the subtle charm conveyed
to their readers by their "argot" and "idiom"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[Pg lxxii]</a></span>&mdash;as
inferior as they are plentiful. There is one, however,
that has justly won great favour since its appearance in
<i>Odes Funnambulesques</i> of M. Theodore de Banville.</p>

<p>These two French examples (on page <a href="#Page_214">214</a>) are hackneyed
by frequent quotation, but are so generally regarded as
the most successful of their class that it seemed best not
to omit them, nor this one by Froissart, given in most
authorities, and called a rondeau by the writer (rondel,
rondeau, and triolet being evidently regarded as but one
form in his day&mdash;the beginning of the fifteenth century),
and the modern grouping completely unknown:&mdash;</p>

<p>The weak point of the Triolet being the monotony of its
refrain, every attempt, at giving a new accent to the
words, short of actual punning, is welcomed as a
relief. There is an air composed by Charles Delioux, to
which all triolets in the pure form may be sung. De
Banville quotes the melody in his "Odes Funnambulesques."
Most people who have attempted to make
rhymes know that when once a haunting melody gains
control the words and sentences will try and fit themselves
to it; so perhaps a would-be writer of triolets could
secure correct form by learning this tune and writing
his triolets to it. It is quite certain that this alone
would not ensure a good poem, but it might keep one to
the usual rhythm and exact number of syllables, with
the correct musical accent, singularly near, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[Pg lxxiii]</a></span>
identical, with the poetical one, when properly used. A
quaint example found by Mr. Dobson in an old French
play is given on page <a href="#Page_214">214</a>, as it has not hitherto been
printed in England.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Villanelle</span> has been called "the most ravishing
jewel worn by the Muse Erato." The large number of
Villanelles in modern English was the most unexpected
find that came to light in the course of collecting material
for the present volume. Many of these fulfil a condition
now held strictly binding, since promulgated by Joseph
Boulmier in his own Villanelles&mdash;that is, that their
length should imitate the example of Jean Passerat's
famous model, and be complete in nineteen lines. The
rules sound simple, and the result must read easily; but
the ease is only to be attained by an elaborate amount
of care in production, which those who read only would
hardly suspect existed. The accepted model for all to
follow will be found on page <a href="#Page_242">242</a>. The example that
follows is an interesting translation by Boulmier of
Mr. Dobson's Villanelle, "When I saw you last, Rose,"
first printed by his permission in <i>Longman's Magazine</i>
(under the heading "At the Sign of the Ship") for
July 1887:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Villanelle is written in five three-lined stanzas,
concluding with one of four lines. It will be seen that
the refrain occupies eight of the nineteen lines, and is
of paramount importance; taken from the first and
third line of the first stanza, the two supply alternately
the last lines from the second to the fifth verse, and both
conclude the quatrain which ends the villanelle. Two
rhymes only are allowed. The refrains must repeat in
the order quoted in the example, the first refrain to conclude
the second and fifth stanzas, the second refrain
for the first, third, and fifth, and both for the sixth.</p>

<p>"The primitive <i>Villanelle</i> was, in truth, a 'shepherd's
song,' and, according to custom, its 'thoughts should
be full of sweetness and simplicity,'" a hint given in a
"Note on some Foreign Forms of Verse" that has been
taken to heart by later writers, who almost invariably
select pastoral or idyllic subjects for this most artificial
but dainty lyric. Mr. Joseph Boulmier's "<i>Les Villanelles</i>,"
Paris, 1878, contains a valuable essay on the
history and construction of the poem, and a series of
forty original Villanelles, with twenty-two other poems,
all of singular beauty.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lai</span> and the <span class="smcap">Virelai</span> are so nearly related that
they must be considered together. De Gramont says,
that the <i>lai</i> has been unused since the earliest days
in French poetry, but as it is invariably quoted in all
treatises on the art, he prints a seventeenth century
one, evidently written as a specimen to illustrate its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[Pg lxxv]</a></span>
laws. De Banville cites the following by Pere Mourgues,
from his <i>Trait&eacute; de la Poesie</i>:&mdash;</p>

<h3>LAI.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sur l'appui du Monde<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que faut-il qu'on fonde<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fait voir<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Et l'orage y gronde<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Le Soir.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As no examples of the Lai are included in this volume,
by the courtesy of the author I am allowed to quote the
following:&mdash;</p>

<h3>FROM OVERSEA.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">From oversea&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Violets, for memories,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hither to thither oversea.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right">&mdash;<i>William Sharp.</i></p>

<p>In the French example the form is seen to be composed
of couplets of five syllable lines, all on the same rhyme,
separated by single lines of two syllables, also on one
rhyme throughout the stanza, which therefore employs
but two rhymes. The number of lines in each verse
was not fixed, nor the number of verses in the complete
poem. The <span class="smcap">Lai</span> has preserved a curious old tradition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[Pg lxxvi]</a></span>
in the form it appears either in writing or print.
As in the verse quoted, the first letter of each line
begins exactly under the preceding one; not with the
short line indented&mdash;that is coming under the middle of
the larger ones&mdash;usual in other poems composed of lines
of irregular length. This detail was called <i>Arbre fourchu</i>
(a forked tree), from the fanciful resemblance of a trunk
with bare branches projecting, found by imaginative
persons in its appearance on paper.</p>

<p>In the Lai each fresh stanza of the poem has its own
two rhyme sounds, without reference to the preceding
ones. By curtailing this liberty, and compelling each
succeeding stanza to take the rhyme for its longer lines,
from the short line of the preceding verse the Virelai is
produced.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Virelai</span> (ancien) is a lai that preserves a sequence
of rhymes throughout. For example, in a twelve-line
stanza the rhymes are <span class="smcap">A.</span> <span class="smcap">A.</span> b. <span class="smcap">A.</span> <span class="smcap">A.</span> b. <span class="smcap">A.</span> <span class="smcap">A.</span> b. <span class="smcap">A.</span> <span class="smcap">A.</span> b.
(the long lines being marked by capital letters, and the
shorter by small ones). Therefore, to follow the rules of
the virelai, the next verse must have its rhymes <span class="smcap">B.</span> <span class="smcap">B.</span>
c. <span class="smcap">B.</span> <span class="smcap">B.</span> c. <span class="smcap">B.</span> <span class="smcap">B.</span> c. <span class="smcap">B.</span> <span class="smcap">B.</span> c., and the next <span class="smcap">C.</span> <span class="smcap">C.</span> d. <span class="smcap">C.</span> <span class="smcap">C.</span> d.,
and so on until the last verse (taking seven verses for an
example) would have <span class="smcap">G.</span> <span class="smcap">G.</span> a. <span class="smcap">G.</span> <span class="smcap">G.</span> a. <span class="smcap">G.</span> <span class="smcap">G.</span> a. <span class="smcap">G.</span> <span class="smcap">G.</span> a.,
its short lines rhyming with the two first lines of the
poem. Thus each rhyme appears twice, once in its
longer couplets, once in the short single lines. In the
English examples this rule is preserved, but the length
of the lines are frequently varied.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Virelai</span> (Rhythme d'Alain Chartier) by Boulmier
may be quoted as a form yet unused (I believe) in
England.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The rhymes are a, a, a, a, b; a, a, a, b; b, b, b, b,
a; b, b, b, b, a. As but one example has come to
notice, so it must speak for itself, for it would be
unfair to deduce rules from a single specimen. Before
leaving this heading there is another form, the
<i>Virelai nouveau</i>, singularly unlike its name. It is
curious that both the Rondeau Redoubl&eacute; and this one,
masquerading under the names of well-known forms,
should be each unlike their unqualified title, and yet so
nearly akin to the other.</p>

<p>The <i>Virelai nouveau</i> is written throughout in two
rhymes. Like the <i>rondeau redoubl&eacute;</i>, its first stanza
serves as refrain for the later ones, but its initial verse
is but a couplet, and the two lines close each stanza
alternately until the last, where they appear both
together, but in inverse order. Unfortunately, space
forbids an example being quoted in its complete length.
The one usually chosen is "Le Rimeur Rebut&eacute;;" this
commences with the couplet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Adieu vous dy, triste Lyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">C'est trop appr&ecirc;ter &agrave; rire.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">[Pg lxxviii]</a></span></p>
<p>Then follows a five-line stanza, rhyming a, a, b, a, a, with
"Adieu vous dy," etc., for its last line; then an eight-lined
one rhymed a, b, a, a, b, a, b, a, the last line
being "<i>C'est trop</i>," etc.; that is followed by a four-line
one closing with first line; then a sixteen-line one,
using the second line for its refrain; then a seventeen-line
one, with first line ending it; and finally a five-line
stanza, its last lines being&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">C'est trop appr&ecirc;ter &agrave; rire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adieu vous dy, triste lyre.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If this description conveys its intended meaning, it will
be seen that the verses are singularly irregular in form,
and choose both the order of the rhymes and the length of
the verses exactly at the will of the poet; but each paragraph
must not only use its proper refrain to close with,
but must bring it in naturally and easily as an inherent
part of the verse. The last two lines in the inverted
order must also be worked in with equal skill. Excepting
one by Mr. Austin Dobson, that appeared in <i>Evening
Hours</i> about 1878, this form has been unused, or at
least unpublished, in English verse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The poems in the following collections have been
chosen for several reasons&mdash;some for their intrinsic excellence,
some as examples of pure form, some for their
bold attempts to produce variations from the typical
models. There has been no limit to the subjects, since
the purpose was to give a representative group of the
rhythms, treated in the most diverse ways. Even burlesque
and diatribe of the use of the forms, masquerading
in guise of the enemy they professed to attack, have been
welcomed, as the points of the construction of the verse
are often seen more clearly in such examples. For
similar reasons the parody of the pioneer Ballade, Mr.
Austin Dobson's <i>Prodigals</i>, is quoted, since the doubtful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">[Pg lxxix]</a></span>
honour of parody is at least a proof of wide popularity,
the only others marked in this way being Mr. Swinburne's
'<i>Dreamland</i>' and Mr. Lang's '<i>Primitive Man</i>.'
Here, too, in default of a better place, it may be noted
that Mr. Henley's 'Villonism' is not an imitation of
the incomprehensible ballades in 'Jargon' or 'Jobelin,'
but a paraphrase in thieves' patter of to-day of Villon's
<i>Ballade of Good Counsel</i>.</p>

<p>It may be that such a medley of themes handled in so
many different ways, was never of set purpose grouped
side by side before, but is to be hoped that a method
in the madness will be found. While conscious of a
few noteworthy examples, Rossetti's <i>Translations from
Villon</i> to wit, being not included for reasons beyond my
control, so it may be that one or two here inserted would
have been replaced by later comers, had they not gone
to the printer's eternity of stereotype. Started as a
collection, but turned perforce to a selection, from the
increasing number available, they yet do not aim so
much at being a selection of the best work solely, as
of the best and least-accessible examples. This explanation
of the progress and purpose of the volume is
offered in common fairness both to its readers and to
those authors who have permitted their works to be
included, also to those who by oversight or too late
discovery on my part have no examples of their poetry
included herein.</p>

<h3>THE GLORY OF THE YEAR.</h3>

<span class="i0">When Spring came softly breathing o'er the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With warmer sunshine and sweet April shower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bidding the silken willow leaves expand;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Calling to hill and meadow, bee and flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright with new life and beauty; on light wing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bringing the birds again to love and sing;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
<span class="i2">And waking in the heart its joy amain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With old fond hopes and memories in its train;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Childishly glad mid universal cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How oft we sang the half-forgotten strain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Now</i> we behold the glory of the year!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Summer by her fervid breezes fanned,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With footstep free and proud in restless power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With plump, round cheek to ruddy beauty tanned,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In blooming loveliness came to her bower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her golden tresses loosely wandering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wild luxuriance,&mdash;then pretty Spring<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seemed but a playful sister, pettish, vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How well we loved the passionate Summer's reign!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How day by day our empress grew more dear!<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when grave Autumn's ever bounteous hand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Poured round our feet the riches of her dower:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pulpy fruit, the nut's sweet ripened gland,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The largess free to gleaner and to plower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the Summer sought in vain to bring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When stood the hills in glorious garmenting;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Shorn of her loveliness, in Fortune's lower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naked for Winter's scourge to smite and sting.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How godlike came the world's new sceptered King!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
<span class="i2">He fettered fast her torrents with his chain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bound with his manacles the moaning main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, wrought his will with all things far and near.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"At last," we said, "what more can Time attain?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At one light finger-touch his captives fling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their shackles off and make the valleys ring<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With praises to the conqueror of pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All the lost lives that languishing have lain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaves, grasses, buds, and birds again appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"O now!" we cried again and yet again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Now</i> we behold the glory of the year!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">In fair Provence, the land of lute and rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arnaut, great master of the lore of love,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wears in the midst of all its storm of woe,-<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As some loud morn of March may bear a rose,-<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To take that kiss that brought her so much woe,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">With her forever, basking in its light,<br /></span>
